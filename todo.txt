Write a command line utility that allows sensor queries
and updates using node.js. This is to replace the C
coded one currently built under Cygwin.

The command line utility can allow it to act as the sensor
posting updates and getting back settings/commands, or act
as the application retrieving sensor readings and posting
updates to the sensor settings tables.
