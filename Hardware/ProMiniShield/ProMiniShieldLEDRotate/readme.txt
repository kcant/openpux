See eagle.txt, KEYWORDS: ProMiniShieldDesign

DIO5_GREEN => PD5(T1)   90 ohm  == Arduino D5 (PWM)
DIO6_BLUE  => xxx(xxx ) 90 ohm  == Arduino D6 (PWM)
DIO9_RED   => PB1(OC1A) 152 ohm == Arduino D9 (PWM)


It also has a push button for RESET to GND.

It also has edge connectors for unconnected signals.
