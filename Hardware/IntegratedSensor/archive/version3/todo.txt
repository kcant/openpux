*** MY HEADER APPEARS REVERSED COMPARED TO ADA BOARDDUINO!!!! ***
*** LOOK AT ARDUINO UNO AS WELL ***
- Add FTDI header
  - Add DTR reset circuit



- Add ICSP programming header

- Add battery voltage monitoring

- Convert LED to common anode
  - More common, cheaper
  - Validate in Sparkfun parts list, Ada Fruit as well
   https://www.sparkfun.com/products/105
    - $1.95 common cathode

    https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10820
    - $1.95 common anode

  // 25 for $19.95 ($.80 each)

   - So this appears to be an adafruit thing for a discount on her
     25 pack since its used by led drivers which sink rather than
     source their LED driver current.

- Correct LED layout
   - I have my own library part
