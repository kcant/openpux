MenloFramework is a TradeMark (TM) of MenloPark Innovation LLC.

This software is available under an Open Source or Commercial
licensing model.

Open Source

The Open Source license is The GNU General Public License V3.0 (GPLv3)
which is available from http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html

GPLv3 requires the source code to the MenloFramework and any changes be
made available to end users. This includes any code for an application
which links with the library.

MenloParkInnovation LLC includes the following additional restrictions
to the license.

1) The attribution mark "Using MenloFramework" must be included
with the device, its documentation, utilities, signon and promotions.

2) The end user must have the ability to update the firmware of the
device from the provided source code that includes the MenloFramework,
any modifications and additions to the MenloFramework, and the embedded
application. This must be the full featured application as delivered
commercially to the customer and not a reduced function version.

3) Measures may not be taken such as programming software protection
fuses, using encryption services, cutting off pins, or otherwise
disabling the re-programability of the device. If you are using
one-time programmable devices please see the Commercial License
section.

The reasons for these restrictions is that MenloParkInnovation LLC
desires to build a community of Open Source IoT and "Maker" devices.

MenloParkInnovation LLC encourages manufacturers of consumer IoT and
"Maker" devices to use the MenloFramework (TM) source code in their
devices in an open source manner.

In order to ensure the purchaser of any products using the MenloFramework
may continue to enhance the devices, or provide support for no longer
supported products the user must have the ability to update the firmware
on the device. This means protection fuses, cutting off of programming pins,
etc. are not allowed, thus enabling the end users the ability to
reprogram the device.

It is ok to require users to have to acquire industry standard low cost
programmers if that is required based on the selected microcontroller.

The easier users can update their device, the easier it is for product
support and updates as well.

It is the belief of MenloParkInnovation LLC that consumer and "Maker"
IoT devices built upon an open framework will have a broader market potential
and appeal as they are adapted to specific end user scenarios. The
availability of open, consumer ready devices built upon open frameworks
will help accelerate the adoption of IoT.

Commercial

Commercial licenses are available from MenloParkInnovation LLC at
menloparkinnovation@gmail.com. Note that any community contributions
to the open source forks may not be available under commercial licensing
unless the contributor has made it available commercially. The original,
core MenloFramework is available under a commercial license.
