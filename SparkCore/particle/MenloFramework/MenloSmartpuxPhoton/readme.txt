Arduino/Libraries/MenloSmartpuxCloud now replaces this file
for projects based on the MenloFramework.

This file is *only* for projects that do not use the
MenloFramework, but is designed to be easy to add
to these existing projects without having to convert
to the MenloFramework's event driven structure.

*********** NOTE ***********

Menlo Smartpux client that works with www.smartpux.com
or openpux Node.js based IoT framework.

This can be dropped into any Photon project stand-alone without
having to use the MenloFramework's other runtime files.

This is ideal for adding smartpux.com IoT web support to existing
projects.
