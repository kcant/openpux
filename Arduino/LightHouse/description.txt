Custom built (model) lighthouse weather station using the following:

 - SparkFun WeatherShield + Redboard (Arduino clone) programmed using
   MenloFramework (TM) and its WeatherStation application module to stream
   NMEA 0183 weather data.

 - MenloSensor (TM) custom built low power wireless LightHouse/Buoy controller
   using MenloFramework (TM) and its LightHouse application module.

 - Lighthouse provides light station function, light intensity, and low
   power 2.4Ghz wireless radio connection.

 - Lighthouse receives NMEA 0183 weather data and re-transmits it
   on the low power 2.4Ghz radio to the gateway.

 - Indoor gateway consisting of a USB connected Arduino Pro Mini +
   low power 2.4Ghz radio on a custom built MenloNRFMini radio shield.
   This is programmed with the MenloFramework (TM) and its Gateway application
   module.

 - The indoor gateway module is small and may be placed at the end of
   a longer USB cable away from the RaspberryPi or Macbook Air. This is
   to allow for better positioning of the antenna where required.

 - Other Gateway hardware options are the SparkFun Pro Micro with embedded USB
   or Teensy 3.1 ARM based microcontroller. In addition a standard Arduino
   Uno, Mega, or Due may be used as well with the MenloNRFShield(TM). All are
   supported by the MenloFramework(TM) and its Gateway application module.

 - Indoor RaspberryPi, or MacBook Air running the MenloDweet server application
   portion of the MenloFramework(TM) programmed using Node.js over the USB
   connection to the gateway.

 - RaspberryPi can be placed on a convenient window sill near a power outlet
   and wirelessly connect to the LightHouse WeatherStation and WiFi.

 - Bridge to the internet is through WiFi on the RaspberryPi or Macbook Air
   through a standard commercial WiFi access point and internet service provider.

 - Since the gateway/internet/cloud software is based on Node.js it can operate
   on any platform that supports node and the npm package nodeserial USB serial
   port access module.

   Tested platforms include:

     - Macbook Air
     - Linux
     - RaspberryPi Linux (Raspian)
     - Microsoft Windows

Hardware:

 - Lighthouse is a modified garden lighthouse statue from Sportsmans Guide.

 - Wind/Rain information is from Argent Data Systems and available through
   sparkfun.com and directly interface to the SparkFun weather shield.

 - GPS option is included in the SparkFun weather shield and supported
   by the MenloFramework(TM) WeatherStation application module.

 - Solar power is provided by a Harbor Freight 1.5W 12V battery charger/booster
   solar panel into a standard 5 A/H 12V AGM alarm backup battery. Power for
   the Weatherstation is provided through a low cost automobile 12V to USB
   cell phone charger connected to the battery.

Other Details:

 - The model lighthouse provides full lighthouse/buoy functions with
   programmable light sequence, color, rate.

 - Automatically handles day/night through the light sensor.

 - Can also be used as a continous walkway/garden light as well.

 - Can change color and sequence remotely over the internet (cloud) to suit the
   season.
 
 - Can use cloud service to program on/off times, etc.

 - Lighthouse light can be programmed to indicate weather station status
   as well.
