Try and place the output buffer in the common DweetChannel.h
so that its shared by all DweetChannels.

Most embedded firmware only sends one at a time.

Design it so that an optional buffer can be supplied for cases where
its async on multiple channels on output.

Currently MenloNMEA0813 requires a buffer from the DweetChannel to
allow it to format to and checksum/send from. Each DweetChannel supplies
a unique output buffer to each unique NMEA0183 instance.

It may make more sense to share a MenloNMEA0183 instance and buffer
through MenloDweet. But this would involve making it a static which
does make things more complicated.

  - But could be the way for DweetChannels by default to share an instance,
    but allow their initialization to supply an alternate non-shared instance
    when they want to supply their own buffers.

The goal is to decrease duplication of the 80 byte output buffer for
each DweetChannel, and allow broadcast Dweets to be supported across
all DweetChannels by an embedded device.

Each DweetChannel still needs its own input buffer though.
