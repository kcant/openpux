Working on making this the basis for many generic projects.

DweetSensorApp:

  #- Generate events when the hardware support needs to process

  #- move hardware out to a sub class

  #- Ensure it uses the updated Dweet even handler model

Make a WiFi version that re-uses as much of MenloRadioDweetSensor in common.

Add support for Dweet over WiFi.
