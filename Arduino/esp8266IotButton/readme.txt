To make a product, the following should be added:

 Configuration by USB for default parameters for factory setup.

 Unique serial number per unit.

 Some sort of account crypto key.

 Better light flashing diagnostics.

 Low power sleep mode, wake on interrupt when button is pushed.

 HTTPS support.

 Access Point mode in out of the box setup for use by a cell phone to
 configure. Would show a simple small mobile web page from the web server
 capabilities. Once configured would then switch into operation mode.

 Long button press after battery insertion would signal reset to
 factory defaults.

 Node.js utility for USB configuration by consumer if hotspot option
 is not available.
