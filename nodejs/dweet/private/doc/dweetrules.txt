Dweet Command Rules

John Richardson

02/01/2015

All Dweet commands and data must be ASCII printable characters.

This is from NMEA 0183, and additional Dweet restrictions to keep it readable
without data scopes, line monitors, etc.

The characters "$,*\r\n" are not allowed. These are NMEA 0183 sentence
structure characters.

 Allowed:
   'a-z', 'A-Z', '0-9', '!@#%^&(){}|;?/<>,.:;-_+=~"

 Disallowed:
   all else. note that " " is not in the allowed set.

 Recommended:
   Use english words. Don't make commands look like an accidental binary
   dump, even if they are printables.

The characters "_:" have special meaning in Dweet commands.

"_" may not be used in COMMAND names.
  - Used to separate COMMAND from replies.

":" may not be used in COMMAND values.
  - Used to separate name from value.

Commands are in the following format(s):

Note: Upper case is used for COMMAND's. Upper or
lower case may be used for NAME:value, though upper
case is typical for NAME.

An implemention is free to ignore commands of non-upper
case.

COMMAND=NAME
COMMAND=NAME:value

Replies to the previous commands are:

COMMAND=NAME
COMMAND_REPLY=NAME       // if no value to be returned
COMMAND_REPLY=NAME:value // if there is a value to be returned
COMMAND_ERROR=NAME       // error
COMMAND_UNSUP=NAME       // not supported by target

COMMAND=NAME:value
COMMAND_REPLY=NAME:value // success
COMMAND_ERROR=NAME:value // error
COMMAND_UNSUP=NAME:value // not supported by target

NMEA 0183 Sentence Rules

All Dweet commands are carried in NMEA 0183 sentences. As such NMEA 0183
rules apply.

$PDWT,COMMAND1_NAME:value,COMMAND2_NAME:value*00\r\n

"$,*\r\n" are part of the NMEA 0183 sentence structure and can't be
used for the payload portion. As such these are not allowed
for Dweet commands and values.

NMEA 0183 specifies only 7 bit characters. Dweet further restricts
this to the "printables" set.

Maximum line length is 82 characters including the \r\n. This
is a maximum payload of 71 characters once the overhead of
"$PDWT,*00\r\n" is subtracted.

All Dweet commands and their responses must fit within this payload
limit or will be dropped. This is since small devices have a maximum
buffer of 82 bytes for processing NMEA 0183 sentences.

(Actually 83 is used for a "safe" null terminator not part of the
 protocol and place by receive code).
