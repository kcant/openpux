NMEA 0183 History

John Richardson 02/01/2015

(This is an outline of a talk on the roots of Dweet)

This may seem like a longish history, but the high end marine
instrumentation environment of 1990 is applicable to todays maker/consumer
Internet Of Things and the Cloud.

What is NMEA 0183?

My first exposure to NMEA 0183 was in high end networked marine instruments
for a racing sailboat. These instruments where "state of the art" for 1989/1990.

Such a system consists of many networked sensors positioned throughout the boat
that broadcast information about boat speed, depth, compass direction,
apparent wind speed, apparent wind angle, Loran/GPS position information, etc.
In NMEA 0183 terms these are called "talkers".

This information is then picked up at a "head unit" acting as a "listener"
which then processes the information and re-broadcasts derived values
as a "talker" itself.

The raw information from the sensors, and more importantly the derived
calculated information is then displayed by many networked "display units"
positioned throughout the boat in the navigation station, helm, and
useful areas such as mast head displays for the crew to keep their eyes
on critical boat speed/wind direction parmeters. The system had various
ways of configuring which information is displayed where at any given moment
and can change based on the boats tactical situation.

Given the technology of the day these are the technical parameters of the
technology this system was built on.

Remember, these instruments had to operate in a harsh marine environment
(humid salt air) and provide moderate battery draw from the boats systems.
When sailboats are racing, there is no motor, so all power comes from a storage
battery.

To provide protection from the environment devices tended to be sealed, even
epoxy bedded to keep the salt air and moisture out. This impacts the tradeofs
between power/cooling since thermal conduction through the case is the cooling
model. In many instances, the device may be operating in an 80-90 degree
environment as well due to sunlight exposure, sailing in the tropic's (:-)),
etc.

Higher power processors of the day (such as a 386/386sx) would not operate
with low power draw in a sealed thermal conduction environment. Using
an "embedded PC" with a high power processor, DRAM memory, hard drive, etc,
was not an option for the main instrumentation system, and especially for
its many sensors.

Though on board ship "management PC's" started becoming popular in the
early to mid 1990's first on power boats with the electrical supply
and room, and then eventually on sailboats. The author himself did
use a 386sx-16Mhz laptop with 2MB of RAM and MS-DOS to run self-written logging
and tactical situation software that ran from a 12v storage battery shared
with the instruments. This large 70-80 A/H lead acid battery provided
enough power (barely) for an overnight race. (Mostly due to draw from
navigation lights (pre-LED's!), Loran (Google it), etc.)

Processors such as Z80's which were available in low power CMOS forms
were used. Typical device configurations were a 2-4Mhz Z80 with 16k-32k of
ROM/EEPROM and 2-8k of RAM. Non-volatile configuration storage was typically
provided by battery backed "watch chip" popular in PC's of the day
for system time of day clock and BIOS settings. These had on board about
100-200 bytes of non-volatile RAM until the button cell battery died.

NMEA 0183 is a "salty" prototocol. It has its origins in the marine
instrument industry. NMEA stands for
"National Marine Manufacturers Electronic Assocation" and is a standards
group for marine instrumentation. Many of the standards developed by
NMEA are also adopted by the aviation, military, and geo-location/survey
as well. This makes these standards broadly used, and not just about boats.

The principle problem NMEA 0183 was designed to solve was interoperation
between networked instrumentation that mostly consists of "talkers" which
provide position information (Loran, GPS, Satellite), various vehicle sensors
vehicle speed, direction, altitude, and parameters of the environment such
as barometric pressure, wind speed, wind direction, air/water temperature, etc.

This information was then consumed by "listeners" which can display this
data in multiple locations such as in a cockpit, auxilary operating
station, etc. 

(at the time of the mid-late 1980's) 

NMEA 0183 has provisions for broadcast messages with "talkers" and "listeners"
with embedded sender ID's and message names being used to distinguish talkers.
This model is not used by Dweet since its oriented more towards broadcasts of
continously updated information from a handful of well known talkers to
potentially many listeners. This does not fit the command and control
request/response usage that constitute basic Dweet operations.

NMEA 0183 was choosen since its essentially a printable ASCII character
based text protocol with built in framing markers and checksums. As such
it operates in a serial port environment in which data may arrive at any
time in any character group, occasional characters may be dropped or
corrupted, and it operates over moderate speeds. It was designed for an era
of Z80 processors with 16k of ROM and maybe 2-4k of RAM which fits nicely
with todays small ($2.x US) microcontrollers such as the Atmel AtMega 328
series used in the Arduino Uno, derivatives, and clones. The processors
32k of on board flash, 2K of RAM, and 1K of EEPROM exactly fits the late
1980's, early 1990's "higher end" networked marine instrument devices.

Due to its adoption in the marine instrument industry, particularly
navigation devices such as Loran and then GPS's, pretty much every
consumer GPS communicates using the NMEA 0183 protocol with the GPS
"vocabulary" in the sentences. So many embedded developers are already somewhat
familar with the protocol if only due to direct reading of GPS serial message
streams.

Summarize on the end:

The consumer opportunity:

How is NMEA 0183 and todays Internet Of Things similar to
the Delorean in "Back to the Future"?

Back To the Future:

 - Really fitting since 1985 is around the technology point!

 - The Cloud is the "Flux Capacitor" that provides the quantum leap
   to what was an old product configuration.

   - The Delorean in many ways may have been an unreliable "bad car"
     in many ways (sorry collectors! (Though you can sell me yours :-)),
     but with the Flux Capacitor it was a different vehicle entirely.

   - Todays technology means that "Deloreans" are available for $625
     new vs. $25,000. With everyone owning a Flux Capacitor
     (internet connection to the Cloud), their usefulness has skyrocketed!

     - Z80, 16K SRAM, 32K EPROM, watchchip, board space ~= $100 in 1985

     - AtMega 328 ~=$2.50 in 2015 price.

   - How well would time travel Deloreans sell if they were priced at $625
     and mass produced?

     - Ok, take inflation into account. Delorean == Corvette more or less
       in market price/target. So 2.32 * 625 == $1450. They would still sell.
       
 What has changed?

  - Cost. Now really cheap for the sensors, chips, displays.

  - Scale. Consumer rather than high end marine.

  - Cloud. Networked services, vs. local processing and storage.

  - Integration with the world, not just the local boat.
