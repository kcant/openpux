Radio Dweets

Dweet support for low power small packet size radios.

John Richardson

02/14/2015

Problem Space

Small packet radios such as the Nordic Semiconductor nRF24L01+ provide
energy efficient short range communication. They are oriented towards
battery powered devices that can run for months on standard AA cells
such as computer mice + keyboards, or indefinitely using solar recharging
such as with Menlo SmartPux (TM) sensors.

They tend to have 16-32 byte packet formats, moderate speeds, and
moderate distances such as 50-100'. Their usage model is to spend as little
time on the air as possible to maximize battery life. Their operating current
draw when on the air are typically 11-16ma for both receive + transmit.

These radios tend to operate in noisy environments sharing the radio
channel with WiFi units, microwave ovens, remote controls, etc., so keeping
messages to a single small packet has the significant advantages of
less frequent packet loss and re-transmissions.

Dweet can operate transparently over Menlo's "Radio Serial" which is a low
overhead protocol for modeling serial port data streams over small packet
radios. As Dweet messages are based on higher level printable ASCII
characters they tend to to be longer in the range from 40-80 characters.

This results in the transmission and successful reception of multiple small
radio packets being required in order to deliver a single Dweet message.
Since a single missing packet can result in retransmission of the entire
Dweet message, overhead can be high in noisy environments.

Dweet Small Message Format

One solution is a Dweet Small Message format that allows compact messages
to be sent and received that can be sent in a single radio packet.

These are standard Dweet messages in every way, but they use very
compact command encodings. They do take advantage of the fact that
the radios are already framed, and perform CRC/ECC checking so
the "*00\r\n" is can be left out of the packet saving 5 critical
bytes.

Dweet minimum overhead for standard serial messages:

$PDWT,*00\r\n

For a small radio which supports framing and CRC/ECC can use:
$PDWT,

This gives 26 bytes for command messages.

With single character Dweet commands, plus the required "=",
results in:

$PDWT,A=

This allows 24 bytes of parameters.

To save space, replies are the lower case letter for the
command.

Example encoding:

SETCONFIG=       -> A=
SETCONFIG_REPLY= -> a=
?? ERROR?
?? UNSUP?

- Could just standardize a lookup table for each command and
  reply including error varients and use the entire 256 bytes
  of coding space.

- "=" not needed since command is always a single byte.

A given channel encode the major Dweet channels of $PDWT, $PDBG
in a single bit. This bit can be encoded in the radio packet type.

Byte 0 - packet type
  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0

  Bit 7 - 0 == $PDWT
  Bit 7 - 1 == $PDBG


Byte xx - data byte 0
 ...
Byte 31 - data byte n

Background on Sensor Radios

1) Small packet radios such as the Nordic Semiconductor nRF24L01+

  - 16-32 byte packet size
  - moderate 250k-2Mb transmission speeds
  - 11-16ma operating current.
  - intended for mostly sleeping, with short, bursty time on air when
    there is something to send. (such as a key type, mouse movement)
  - battery life for two AA cells in months
  - Solar recharge or energy scavange indefinitely.

2) Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) a sub-set of the Bluetooth 4.0 specification

  - Packet size hidden by higher level protocol
  - 1mb - 2mb transmissions speeds
  - Moderate 16ma operating current
  - Intended to be low power when sleeping, but on the air for moderate
    amounts of time when connected/paired.
  - battery life for months on cells for short formats, or leverage
    batteries for a device such as a phone/tablet.
  - Higher overhead "chatty" protocol with built in serial port
    channels (serial profile). Less emphasis on sending a small
    single packet.

3) WiFi

  - Larger packet sizes.
  - High speed transmissions, 10mb and above
  - High operating current 250-300ma
  - Intended to be "always on" and connected.
  - Intended for wired connections, or moderate amounts of
    operation on battery till the device is recharged.
    (phone, tablet, computer)
  - Operate full TCP/HTTP and peer to peer web protocols.

4) Specialized ISM radios

  - Specialized and custom.
  - For SCADA solutions.
  - Authors opinion they will be overtaken by low cost
    commodity use of the radios above.
  - Some units available for experimenters.
  - Some customers such as government/military will remain
    on these platforms, but will likely increasingly
    gateway to the above radios to take advantage of commodity
    equipment expansion. (Already happening in the military)
