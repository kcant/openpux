npm nodeserial has changed its basic initialization contracts
in 6.x. As a result the initialization code must change.

The hardware nodeserial changes have been made so it works with
physical serial port connected devices , but the changeshave not
been done to radioserial and virtual serial which followed the older
nodeserial contract to allow seamless routing over a packet
radio or local loopbacks for testing/simulation.

The contracts for readioserial and virtualserial must be updated
and all callers as well.

Search for TODO: and fix.
