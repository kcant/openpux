Access to all functions, settings, etc. through curl.
  - includes authentication token. Test compatiblity of openpux tokens.
  - basics with URL
  - more complex with uploaded json file

Application configuration is apps/camera/camera.json, and the
master config points to the valid apps, or its in the data
base.

Could have a subdirectory in which apps are automatically loaded.

  apps/default/..

Takes a picture on demand, downloads it to the user.

Take pictures on a schedule, keeps them in the file system.

Pictures such as latest can be used by other applications such
as WhidbeyWeather.

Camera settings are in sensorsettings.

Web page that is specific to the camera that shows the settings,
lets you edit them, etc.

  - Buttons to take a picture, etc.

  - Should be automatically generated from schema/json.

     - really close with current customization web pages.

curl, wget research

Neither is ideal for uploading a .json file and getting back
results.

curl supports urlencoded which can be used.

May still use my utility which allows upload of .json documents,
though the image download if its multi-part mime is trickier.

// -X allows you to specify the HTTP verb
curl -X PUT http://www.smartpux.com/smartpuxdata/data

-H, --header <header>

--oauth2-bearer

Examples from photon.txt

curl -G https://api.particle.io/v1/devices/WeatherStation2/temperature \
  -d access_token=75bf710186884a403d2515b6015be0b87ffb0e87

-d <data>
  sends HTTP data as a POST

  content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded.

  multiple -d options will splice together with "&" as urlencoded

curl https://api.particle.io/v1/devices/WeatherStation2/led \
  -d access_token=75bf710186884a403d2515b6015be0b87ffb0e87 \
  -d params=on

# EXAMPLE REQUEST
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN_GOES_HERE}" \
