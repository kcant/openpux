If you have a RaspberryPi display or monitor hooked up and want to
run the Kiosk mode application, configure the following which will
autorun the application when startx is done.

If you want startx to run at boot, use raspi-config to boot into X.

Note: Update the URL based on your specific application.

sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart

@midori -e FullScreen -a http://localhost:8080/lighthouse.html

#
# Note: You may want to disable the screen saver. If so add:
#

# configure to keep the screen on, no screen saver, no power down
@xset s off
@xset -dpms
@xset s noblank
