Minimal, no-dependencies implementation.

Lets not forget this in the rush to consider meteor, express, etc.

A project using those frameworks is a different target.

Keep updates to following accepted node.js patterns, best practices,
modules that can be used the other more complex projects.

Goal is to run this on IoT gateways such as RaspberryPI's,
Tesslel.Io, etc.

Allow it to load optional modules such as different data storage
providers such as Amazon AWS SimpleDB, Azure Table Store, Google
Row/Column store, etc.

Also allow it to high level communicate with third party IoT
data service providers as well, providing a common "maker"
framework.
